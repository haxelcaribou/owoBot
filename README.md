# owoBot

This is a discord bot implementing my [python port](https://github.com/haxelcaribou/OwO) of @zuzak's [owofier](https://github.com/zuzak/owo). When a message starting with a variation of "owo" is sent, the owobot will owofy the message above it and post it to the channel.

To run you will need my python library installed. Just run the command `pip install text-to-owo` to get it. You will also need to create a secrets.py file where you can put your discord bot token. I suggest using the template provided.
